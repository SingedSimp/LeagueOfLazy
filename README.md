# LeagueOfLazy
Program that goes through league of legends champ select for you. 

This uses python and pyautogui to click on the icons shown on screen to go thorugh champion select

I am aware this could be done better just by using the actual positions on a 1080p monitor, but this was created as a hobby project.

# Important notice

To change champions selected, edit ```main.py``` and change the following variables: ```champion, ban```.

This was done with the game client set to 1600 x 900, you may need to edit line 32 to make it work on your client.
