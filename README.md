# LeagueOfLazy
Program that goes through league of legends champ select for you. 

This uses python and pyautogui to click on the icons shown on screen to go thorugh champion select

I am aware this could be done better just by using the actual positions on a 1080p monitor, but this was created as a hobby project.
